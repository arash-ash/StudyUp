# StudyUp_AndroidApp
An Android application for students to form study groups and arrange meetings in order to study for an upcoming exam or assignment


    Introduction

For most students, getting themselves to study is still a hard habit to achieve. They simply cannot concentrate on studying the subject in hand or might not have formed a solid schedule that they should conform to. However, they are still obliged to do something about their disorganized study habits that they experience all the time in order to practice and grasp the subjects of their courses and get satisfactory grades. We therefore propose a Bilkent specific social platform Android application that will provide an environment for so-called willing-but-lazy students to gather up and study together for the upcoming exams, assignments, labs, etc. which would hopefully make their learning experience more enjoyable. The application includes features that allow them to be notified in advance about future events, to send requests regarding the formation of a table or for accepting other users to the current table in addition to a simple ranking system which guides users to the most suitable study groups and study mates. Our proposed project will show students a glimpse of how being neatly organized feels like.

    Details

2.1. Features Table: The central feature of the application is the ability to create “Tables”(see Fig.13). Table is the name given to a future study session created by the user. When a Table is created it appears in the menu and depending on the filters (see Fig.10), users can view it while scrolling through the Tables menu. Notifications are sent to users who have subscribed to a particular course, topic or admin of a Table (see Fig.8). Those people who have been invited to join are also sent notifications. The followings are features that a table has:

    Shows the course name, topic, location and the total duration time.
    Displays the date and time.
    Allows users to join the table by sending a request to the admin.
    Displays the total available capacity as determined by the admin.
    Displays the number and names of users who have already joined.
    The table greys out when the it gets full.
    Allows admin to change date, location, time or to delete the table.
    Allows admin to accept or deny requests or to remove existing members. If the applicant is accepted to the table by the admin, the applicant will be asked whether they want to join or cancel their seat.

Notifications: Since StudyUp gathers students simultaneously to form a group for effective studying, the notifications have an important role to inform and alarm users about any instant changes. There will be mainly four kinds of notifications that a user will receive if he/she chooses to:

    Instant notifications about a particular topic that the user is subscribed to: After users subscribe themselves to the courses they are taking, they will receive pop-up messages containing all the information (time and location that the study will take place, size of the table and the name of the course) whenever new table is created. If the users would like, they can also receive e-mail notifications.

    Notifications about other users: when the user follows other users (his/her study mates), the user will be able to receive notifications about the study mates he/she is following. For example, when he joins a study group or creates a new study table, his followers will receive notifications of his activity. Also, the users may mute other users that they are following if they do not want to receive such notifications. This ranking system will guide the ones who are indecisive about their table choice or admins who respond to join requests. Also for each table the average of its members’ ranking will be displayed.

    Notifications of a currently joined study group: When a user joins a study
    group, they will be notified about any status change regarding the group: if a new user joins or another one leaves, if the time, location, or the size of the group changes.

    StudyUp requests: users may also receive requests from others for creating a table together. This way, it is guaranteed that the table will have minimum two members.

Communication/Requests: Rather than providing a constantly messaging platform, StudyUp enables the users only have a talk with other users when it is necessary. This feature is designed in this particular way which will avoid the unnecessary chatting that do not serve for the aim of the application. Users will only be able to send messages to each other when they request the following:

    To join a group: Users who would like to join a table which is designed to be private (the permission of the admin is necessary to join the group) may request to join the group. When the user sends the request to the admin, he may also add an additional message along with the request.

    To StudyUp another user: If a user want to start a new table only if a particular user joins his table, the user may send a StudyUp request to another user. In this case, the table is created only when the other user accepts StudyUp request. While sending the request, the user can similarly add a message if he would like.

    To invite a user to the group: The admin can invite another user to an already formed group. Admin may again include a message if necessary.

Ranking: After a particular study session, group members of the session will be able to rank and comment on their group mates’ study habits, behaviour and attitude. The ranking scale will change between 0 to 10 having the following criteria:

a. punctuality i. if the group member arrive and leave on time, and able to keep up the pace with the rest of the group. b. contribution
i. if the group member were able to contributes to the work, problem solving, helping others ... c. compatibility i. if the group member were able to synchronize with others and sustain a peaceful and friendly atmosphere.

2.2. Target Audience The primary demographic that we are targeting are university students. This does not mean that others can not use this app but the app’s features are such that they will prove most beneficial in large educational communities such as universities. Initially, the app will only be available to Bilkent students by
giving access only to users with emails of .bilkent.edu.tr domain. If it proves successful it might be be opened to the broader public.

2.3. Similar Products 1. StudyRoom: Helps create online study groups and allow users to share notes. Differences: People in the study group cannot actually meet. No rating system for study groups, users or topics. 2. OpenStudy: Similar to StudyRoom but mostly for high-schoolers. Differences: Everything is online. People cannot meet and is more suitable for high school subjects.
