# StudyUp_AndroidApp
An Android application for students to form study groups and arrange meetings in order to study for an upcoming exam or assignment


    Introduction

For most students, getting themselves to study is still a hard habit to achieve. They simply cannot concentrate on studying the subject in hand or might not have formed a solid schedule that they should conform to. However, they are still obliged to do something about their disorganized study habits that they experience all the time in order to practice and grasp the subjects of their courses and get satisfactory grades. We therefore propose a Bilkent specific social platform Android application that will provide an environment for so-called willing-but-lazy students to gather up and study together for the upcoming exams, assignments, labs, etc. which would hopefully make their learning experience more enjoyable. The application includes features that allow them to be notified in advance about future events, to send requests regarding the formation of a table or for accepting other users to the current table in addition to a simple ranking system which guides users to the most suitable study groups and study mates. Our proposed project will show students a glimpse of how being neatly organized feels like.
